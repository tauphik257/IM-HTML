            <h3>Naruto</h3>
            <div class="question">
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure destroying much
                        of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed
                        his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto
                        was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself.
                        Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children
                        — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto.
